# Kairos - Documentation

This repository is meant to store all datasheets and documentation from devices
we use on [KairOS](https://gitlab.com/kairos-dev/system) and [Kairos Core](https://gitlab.com/kairos-dev/core), and references from FreeRTOS.

You can find the datasheets from devices on "Devices" folder. Inside this folder we have "Datasheets", used to store datasheets from a specific devices(microcontrollers, sensors, transceivers and so on.).
And "Modules" folder, used to store references from modules we used.
